# Poker

For this program, you will be taking a text input of playing cards and evaluating what the best poker
hand could be constructed with the cards.

For example, given a string input of:
'AS, 10C, 10H, 3D, 3S'

(the cards above are ace of spades, 10 of clubs, 10 of hearts, 3 of diamonds and 3 of spades)

Output would be: 'Two Pair'

Use whatever language you are most comfortable in, however preferably Java if you are familiar with
it. We are looking for evidence of good:
- Object Oriented programming
- design
- test
rather than language skills.

We are interested in seeing how you prioritize features. For us to see that progress, please provide a
git commit history.

For reference, the ten possible poker hands can be found at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hand_categories

Please provide your program as a zipped file of the directory ensuring that the git history file is
included.
